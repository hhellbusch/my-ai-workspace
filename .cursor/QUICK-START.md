# TÂCHES Quick Start for Cursor

**Get started in 2 minutes with native slash commands!**

## ✅ Slash Commands Work Natively!

Cursor auto-discovers commands in `.cursor/commands/`. Just type `/` and they appear!

## Quick Examples

### Example 1: Plan a Project

```
/create-plan Ansible playbook for OpenShift cluster provisioning with HA control plane
```

**That's it!** The command works immediately.

### Example 2: Debug Systematically

```
/debug

My OpenShift pod keeps crashing with CrashLoopBackOff but logs show nothing obvious.
```

**Activates systematic debugging methodology.**

### Example 3: Think Through a Decision

```
/consider:first-principles

Should we use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for deployment?
```

**Applies first-principles thinking framework.**

### Example 4: Create a Handoff

```
/whats-next
```

**Creates structured handoff document for context switching.**
