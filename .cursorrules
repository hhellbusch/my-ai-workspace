# Meta-Development System Configuration

This workspace contains a sophisticated meta-development system with three interconnected components:
- **Skills** (domain expertise modules)
- **Commands** (user-facing slash commands)
- **Agents** (specialized evaluation subagents)

## System Architecture

### Skills (`.cursor/skills/` and `skills/`)

Skills are modular capabilities that provide domain expertise on demand. They use a router pattern with workflows, references, and templates.

**Note:** Skills are located in `.cursor/skills/` for Cursor's native palette integration. The `skills/` directory is kept for reference and documentation.

**Available Skills:**
- `create-agent-skills` - Expert guidance for creating, writing, building, and refining Claude Code Skills
- `create-plans` - Create hierarchical project plans (briefs, roadmaps, phase plans)
- `create-meta-prompts` - Create meta-prompts for complex reasoning tasks
- `create-slash-commands` - Create slash commands following best practices
- `create-subagents` - Create specialized Claude Code subagents
- `create-hooks` - Create Claude Code hooks with input/output schemas
- `debug-like-expert` - Expert-level debugging methodology and investigation
- `expertise/iphone-apps` - iOS/iPhone app development with SwiftUI
- `expertise/macos-apps` - macOS app development with AppKit/SwiftUI

**Invoking Skills:**
When you need to use a skill, reference it with the `Skill()` function or by mentioning it:
```
Skill(create-agent-skills) - invoke the skill directly
@.cursor/skills/create-agent-skills/SKILL.md - reference the skill file
```

**Skill Structure:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Router + essential principles
├── workflows/            # Step-by-step procedures (FOLLOW)
├── references/           # Domain knowledge (READ)
├── templates/            # Output structures (COPY + FILL)
└── scripts/              # Reusable code (EXECUTE)
```

### Commands (`.cursor/commands/` and `commands/`)

Slash commands are user-facing entry points that invoke skills or agents. They use YAML frontmatter with description, allowed-tools, and argument-hint fields.

**Note:** Commands are located in `.cursor/commands/` for Cursor's native command palette. The `commands/` directory is kept for reference and documentation.

**Available Commands:**
- `/create-agent-skill` - Create or edit Claude Code skills
- `/create-plan` - Create hierarchical project plans
- `/create-meta-prompt` - Create meta-prompts
- `/create-slash-command` - Create new slash commands
- `/create-subagent` - Create specialized subagents
- `/create-hook` - Create Claude Code hooks
- `/audit-skill` - Audit skill for best practices compliance
- `/audit-slash-command` - Audit slash command for best practices
- `/audit-subagent` - Audit subagent for best practices
- `/run-plan` - Execute a PLAN.md file
- `/run-prompt` - Execute a prompt file
- `/whats-next` - Create handoff document for fresh context
- `/check-todos` - Review and manage TODO items
- `/add-to-todos` - Add items to TODO list
- `/heal-skill` - Fix and improve problematic skills
- `/debug` - Expert debugging guidance

**Command Format:**
```yaml
---
description: What the command does (clear, specific)
argument-hint: [expected arguments format]
allowed-tools: Skill(skill-name) or Task or specific tools
---

Prompt body with $ARGUMENTS placeholders
```

### Agents (`.cursor/agents/` and `agents/`)

Specialized subagents for complex evaluation and auditing tasks. They have specific roles, constraints, and workflows.

**Note:** Agents are located in `.cursor/agents/` for Cursor integration. The `agents/` directory is kept for reference and documentation.

**Available Agents:**
- `skill-auditor` - Expert skill auditor for SKILL.md files
- `slash-command-auditor` - Expert slash command auditor
- `subagent-auditor` - Expert subagent auditor

**Agent Invocation:**
Agents are typically invoked via commands (e.g., `/audit-skill` invokes `skill-auditor`)

**Agent Structure:**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: What the agent does and when to use it
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: sonnet
---

<role>Agent's role and expertise</role>
<constraints>Hard constraints</constraints>
<critical_workflow>Mandatory workflow steps</critical_workflow>
<success_criteria>When task is complete</success_criteria>
```

## Integration Flow Examples

### Creating a New Skill
```
User: /create-agent-skill [skill description]
  ↓
commands/create-agent-skill.md invoked
  ↓
Skill(create-agent-skills) activated
  ↓
skills/create-agent-skills/SKILL.md loaded
  ↓
User selects option (e.g., "1. Create new skill")
  ↓
workflows/create-new-skill.md executed
  ↓
references/ loaded as needed
  ↓
New skill created
```

### Auditing a Skill
```
User: /audit-skill path/to/SKILL.md
  ↓
commands/audit-skill.md invoked
  ↓
Agent(skill-auditor) spawned
  ↓
agents/skill-auditor.md loaded
  ↓
Reads best practices from skills/create-agent-skills/references/
  ↓
Evaluates skill against standards
  ↓
Returns detailed audit report
```

### Planning and Execution
```
User: /create-plan [what to plan]
  ↓
commands/create-plan.md invoked
  ↓
Skill(create-plans) activated
  ↓
Creates BRIEF.md, ROADMAP.md, phase plans
  ↓
User: /run-plan path/to/PLAN.md
  ↓
commands/run-plan.md invoked
  ↓
Executes plan with intelligent segmentation
  ↓
Creates SUMMARY.md and commits changes
```

## Best Practices

### When Working with Skills
1. **Read SKILL.md first** - It contains routing logic and essential principles
2. **Follow workflows exactly** - They specify which references to load
3. **Use progressive disclosure** - Don't load all references at once
4. **Validate output** - Check success_criteria sections

### When Creating Commands
1. **Clear descriptions** - Describe what it does, not just "helps with"
2. **Appropriate tool restrictions** - Security-sensitive operations need `allowed-tools`
3. **Proper argument handling** - Use `$ARGUMENTS` or positional `$1, $2, $3`
4. **Dynamic context when needed** - Use `!`command`` for state-dependent operations

### When Building Agents
1. **Specific role definition** - Clear expertise area
2. **Strong constraints** - Use MUST/NEVER/ALWAYS
3. **Mandatory workflows** - Critical steps that can't be skipped
4. **Validation before output** - Verify completeness and accuracy

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Skill
```bash
# Option 1: Use the meta-system
Use: /create-agent-skill [description]

# Option 2: Manual creation
mkdir skills/new-skill-name
# Follow structure in skills/create-agent-skills/templates/
```

### Adding a New Command
```bash
# Option 1: Use the meta-system
Use: /create-slash-command [description]

# Option 2: Manual creation
# Create commands/new-command.md with proper YAML frontmatter
```

### Adding a New Agent
```bash
# Option 1: Use the meta-system
Use: /create-subagent [description]

# Option 2: Manual creation
# Create agents/agent-name.md with role, constraints, workflow
```

## Reference Files

- See `INTEGRATION.md` for comprehensive integration guide
- See `skills/REGISTRY.md` for complete skill index
- See `commands/README.md` for command reference
- See `agents/REGISTRY.md` for agent capabilities

## Quality Assurance

Use auditing commands to ensure quality:
```bash
/audit-skill skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
/audit-slash-command commands/my-command.md
/audit-subagent agents/my-agent.md
```

## Context Efficiency

The system is designed for optimal context usage:
- **Skills**: Load only SKILL.md initially, then specific workflows/references
- **Commands**: Minimal YAML + focused prompts
- **Agents**: Self-contained with validation checks

Target: <30% context overhead, reserving 70%+ for actual work.
