# ⚠️  EXAMPLE FILE - DO NOT USE THESE CREDENTIALS IN PRODUCTION
#
# This is a template file with example credentials for demonstration purposes.
# 
# To use:
# 1. Copy this file: cp inventory.example.yml inventory.yml
# 2. Update inventory.yml with YOUR actual credentials
# 3. Ensure inventory.yml is in .gitignore (it should be by default)
#
# The credentials in this file (calvin, password, changeme, etc.) are
# well-known defaults or obvious placeholders. Never use them in production.
