# Notes

Miscellaneous notes and resources organized by topic.

## 📁 Organization

Notes are organized into subdirectories by topic or category:

### Gaming
- **[sc2-music.md](gaming/sc2-music.md)** - StarCraft II music recommendations

## Adding New Notes

When adding new notes:
1. Create a topical subdirectory if it doesn't exist
2. Use descriptive filenames with kebab-case
3. Update this README with a link to your note
4. Consider whether the note belongs here or in a specific project directory

## Guidelines

- **Personal notes** → Keep them here
- **Project-specific docs** → Move to the relevant project (ansible-examples, argo-examples)
- **Technical references** → Consider if they should be in project documentation
- **Learning resources** → Keep them organized by topic
