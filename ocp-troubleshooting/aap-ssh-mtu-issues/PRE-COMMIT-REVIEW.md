## 🎯 Key Messages Consistently Delivered

### 1. SSH Options Are Limited ✅

Consistently explained across all documents:
- SSH cannot directly control MTU or TCP buffers
- Valid options: IPQoS, Compression, ControlMaster, etc.
- Invalid options: TCPRcvBuf, TCPSndBuf, MTU
- SSH provides workarounds, not direct solutions

### 2. Network-Level Fixes Are Primary ✅

Consistently prioritized:
1. MSS clamping on network equipment (best)
2. ICMP unblocking for PMTUD (best)
3. SSH/Ansible workarounds (immediate relief)
4. Cluster MTU change (last resort, disruptive)

### 3. MTU Must Be Uniform ✅

Clearly documented:
- All cluster nodes must have same MTU
- OVN overlay spans all nodes
- Individual node configuration not supported
- Fix at network boundary, not cluster nodes

### 4. AAP-Specific Considerations ✅

Addressed:
- Pod labeling varies by version
- Flexible pod detection methods
- Execution environment customization
- Dedicated node configuration (with constraints)
