# Pre-Publication Review Checklist

## Technical Accuracy ✓

### Commands Verified
- [x] `oc debug node/<node>` - Correct syntax
- [x] `chroot /host` - Standard for accessing node filesystem
- [x] `systemctl restart crio` - Correct service name
- [x] `oc get mcp` - Valid command
- [x] `oc get image.config.openshift.io/cluster` - Correct resource
- [x] JSONPath syntax validated
- [x] Grep patterns tested

### Configuration Files
- [x] policy.json format matches containers/image specification
- [x] JSON syntax validated
- [x] GPG key path `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release` is correct for RHCOS
- [x] Base64 encoding verified (encodes and decodes correctly)

### MachineConfig
- [x] API version `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1` correct
- [x] Ignition version `3.2.0` appropriate for OCP 4.6+ (should add version note)
- [x] File mode `420` (0644) correct for config files
- [x] File path `/etc/containers/policy.json` correct
- [x] Labels correct for targeting master/worker nodes

### Shell Script
- [x] Bash syntax validated
- [x] `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- [x] Error handling present
- [x] User confirmation prompt included
- [x] Prerequisite checks implemented

## Safety Considerations ✓

- [x] Warns about CRI-O restart causing brief disruption
- [x] Creates backups before modifying
- [x] Requires confirmation before proceeding
- [x] Checks for cluster-admin privileges
- [x] Documents that this triggers node operations
- [x] Clearly states to apply permanent fix AFTER MCP completion

## Issues Found & Recommendations

### Minor Issues
1. **FOUND**: Ignition version compatibility not documented
   - **Fix**: Add note that Ignition 3.2.0 is for OCP 4.6+
   - **Severity**: Low (most users on 4.6+)

2. **FOUND**: No mention of OCP version compatibility
   - **Fix**: Add supported versions section
   - **Severity**: Low

### Recommendations
- Consider adding version compatibility matrix
- Could add troubleshooting section for script failures
- May want to mention impact on running pods during CRI-O restart

## Content Quality ✓

- [x] Follows existing guide structure
- [x] Clear symptoms and error messages
- [x] Root cause analysis included
- [x] Investigation workflow present
- [x] Manual step-by-step documented
- [x] Automated solution provided
- [x] Prevention strategies included
- [x] References to related documentation
- [x] AI disclosure present
- [x] Consistent formatting
- [x] Code blocks properly formatted
- [x] Examples are realistic

## Documentation Standards ✓

- [x] Clear section hierarchy
- [x] Proper markdown formatting
- [x] Commands are copy-pasteable
- [x] File permissions documented
- [x] Script executable permissions set
- [x] Integrated into main README.md
- [x] Cross-references to related guides

## Testing Performed ✓

- [x] Shell script syntax validated
- [x] JSON syntax validated
- [x] Base64 encoding/decoding verified
- [x] File structure follows existing patterns
- [x] Commands follow OpenShift conventions

## Status: APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION WITH MINOR ADDITIONS

The guide is technically accurate and ready for publication. 
Adding version compatibility notes would be beneficial but not blocking.
